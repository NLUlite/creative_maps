Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
I 'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there. 
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
